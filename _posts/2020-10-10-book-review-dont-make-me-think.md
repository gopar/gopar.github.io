I decided to pick up [Don't Make Me Think (Revisited)](https://amzn.to/3lCh6SD) to learn more about UI/UX since I'm not that familiar with that topic. And well here is my review:

### Pros
- Author makes it easy to follow and read
- Not technical so anyone can learn what he's teaching.
- Shows best practices and how to not make silly common mistakes.
- Good examples on how to do useability testing


### Cons
- The mobile part is outdated (It was released in 2013) but you get the idea/points he's making from the previous chapters
- Wouldn't recommend to someone who has UI/UX background since this seems like it's only giving a high level over view in the subject.

### Overall

The book is under 200 pages and would *strongly* recommend it for anyone wanting to learn more about UI/UX, or just in general on how the structure of websites came to be.
It's amazing that the things he goes through are pretty simple, but thats the point, simple is best.
